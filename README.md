# INTRODUCTION TO WEB MAPPING USING LEAFLET
Web mapping is the process of using the maps delivered by geographic information systems (GIS) in World Wide Web.
This is achieved by use of mapping libraries both opensource and proprietary. They include: 
- Leaflet
- Openlayers
- Mapbox
- Map4news
- ArcGIS for JavaScript API etc.

This repository focuses on introduction to webmapping using [Leaflet.js](https://leaflet.com/) and [turfjs](https://turfjs.org/) for browser processing.
